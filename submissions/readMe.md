Project Title: Financial Article Dissector

What it does:
The program uses FinBERT which is based on the BERT language model. It is trained for sentiment classification for financial text. My project disects financial articles to find the overall sentiment of the article and can be used to get a 3rd party view of a companies earnings, or compare the biases between different articles.

How to Run:
Run main.py and enter a url to a financial article when prompted.
